## [Project 3 - Exams Project](https://github.com/mgbs98/exams-project)

I decided to participate in this DataCamp challenge to demonstrate some of my Python Skills.

The challenge goes as follows:

"**Background**:

Your best friend is an administrator at a large school. The school makes every student take year-end math, reading, and writing exams.

Since you have recently learned data manipulation and visualization, you suggest helping your friend analyze the score results. The school's principal wants to know if test preparation courses are helpful. She also wants to explore the effect of parental education level on test scores.

**Challenge**:

Create a report to answer the principal's questions. Include:

- What are the average reading scores for students with/without the test preparation course?
- What are the average scores for the different parental education levels?
- Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
- [Optional] Look at the effects within subgroups. Compare the average scores for students with/without the test preparation course for different parental education levels (e.g., faceted plots).
- [Optional 2] The principal wants to know if kids who perform well on one subject also score well on the others. Look at the correlations between scores.
- Summarize your findings."

### **My Key Findings**

#### Prep Course

- Students who completed the prep course performed:

  - 9.0 % better in math;

  - 11.0 % better in reading;

  - 15.0 % better in writing;

  - 12.0 % better on average.

  - This suggests that the prep courses can increase the students' performance in 12% on average

#### Parent's Degree

- Students whose parents have higher degrees performed better overrall

- The gap in performance between students with more educated parents and ones with less educated parents diminishes if the students take the prep course

  - This is especially true if the student's parent had at least some college education

#### Correlation Between Scores

- The scores, in general, are highly correlated. However, the scores in reading and writing have a stronger correlation

- Students who chose the standard lunch option performed 14 % better on average

#### Lunch Option

- Students who chose the standard lunch option performed 14 % better on average

#### Ethnic Groups

- Students from specific ethnic groups performed better than others

  - Students from the best-performing group, Group E, had scores that were, on average, 15 % higher than the worse performing group, Group A

#### Gender

- Female students performed better than male students on average

- However, when we break the data down, we can see that female students performed better in reading and writing, and male students performed better in math.

  - Reading

  - Writing

  - Math

#### Recommendations

- Create incentives for students in general to enroll in the prep course

- Create incentives for students to enroll in the standard lunch option

- Create financial aid programs for students who come from ethnic/racial groups that underperformed

- Create financial aid programs for students whose parents had less education.

- Reinforce math classes for female students or increase the number of math classes for female students who are struggling with the subject.

- Reinforce reading/writing classes for male students or increase the number of reading/writing classes for male students who are struggling with these subjects.

- Since reading and writing scores are highly correlated, it's likely that the reinforcement of one subject increases the score of the other subject as well.

## [Project 2 - Monte Carlo Simulation (Price Prediction)](https://github.com/mgbs98/Monte_Carlo_Simulation-Project)

A personal project to create a Monte Carlo Simulation to predict stock prices, based on my studies.

What is the Monte Carlo Simulation?
A Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty.

A Monte Carlo simulation is used to tackle a range of problems in many fields including investing, business, physics, and engineering.

It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.

## [Project 1 - Portfolio Filter and Optimizer](https://github.com/mgbs98/stock_filtering-efficient_frontier_optimization)

This is a personal project.
I created this Python project to use multiples to filter promising stocks and also the Markowitz efficient frontier model to optimize the portfolio.
